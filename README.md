Simple PostgreSQL download guide:
install PostgresSQL and then with backticks put â€œ/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh) && brew install PostgreSQL"

This project demonstrates a range of postgresql queries.
This project can help others get started on building datasets, cleaning, and interacting with each table.
You can get started with the project by creating your own table. 
I maintain and contribute to the project.

I used PGAdmin to interact with postgre, but you can use the terminal if you want.
